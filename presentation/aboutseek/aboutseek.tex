\section{About Us}

\begin{frame}{What We Do}

\begin{itemize}
\item A technical club managed by students
\item Funded by Student Association at DC \& UOIT
\item Gives practical engineering experience
\item Gives free access of parts to prototype electronics
\item Gives free access of real world software projects
\end{itemize}
\vskip 1cm
\begin{block}{You Take Away}
Real world engineering experience at SEEK. Take credit for engineering design projects you complete. Develop the skills employers need before Co-Op or Intern-Ships.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Big Picture}

\begin{frame}{How We Work}

\begin{figure}

\caption{Flow chart of how SEEK operate as club}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Important}
It takes practical skills to build and re-make. Technology, Math and Science courses teach theory and applications on paper. SEEK gives you technical consulting and resources to make your theory knowledge and creative passion into solutions and products. All for free. Period.
\vskip 0.3cm
\begin{itemize}

\item Learn/use skills to engineer real world products
\item Publish your projects at blogs, academic or industry or campus peer reviewd journals, conferences
\item Use LGPL\textsuperscript{1} to license your prototypes, products
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.3cm \textsuperscript{1}Lesser GNU Public License. Easy explanation on slide~\pageref{LGPL}.
